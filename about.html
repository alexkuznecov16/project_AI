						<span>What is it?</span>
						<p class="about-text">
							Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by
							machines, as opposed to intelligence of humans and other animals.
							Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition,
							computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well
							as other mappings of inputs.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="about-item">
						<span>Who is author?</span>
						<p class="about-text">
							Officially published in 1956 at a summer seminar at Dartmouth
							College (Hanover, USA), which was organized by four American
							scientists: John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and
							Claude Shannon.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="about-item">
						<span>What are the tasks?</span>
						<p class="about-text">
							The main tasks of artificial intelligence are: analysis and
							problem solving, the possibility of self-learning, the ability to
							perceive, reproduce human speech, move and plan movement
							parameters, etc.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="about-item">
						<span>What is the benefit?</span>
						<p class="about-text">
							AI-based technologies help improve work efficiency and
							productivity by automating processes and tasks that were
							previously performed by humans. AI is also able to interpret
							volumes of data that a human cannot interpret.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="about-item">
						<span>What is the problems?</span>
						<p class="about-text">
							The problem of controlling artificial intelligence is a challenge
							in artificial intelligence (AI) engineering and philosophy. It
							consists in creating an artificial superintelligence that will be
							useful to humans, while avoiding the unintentional creation of a
							superintelligence that will cause harm.
